Junior Software Engineer / SystemC Platform Developer
=====================================================

C++/SystemC engineer working in hardware simulation for a variety of chips at Cadence VLAB. Mainly focused on 
the implementation of register-accurate IP blocks, chip integration, and the modernization of existing code. 
Other than being an Electronic Design Automation Engineer, I am also involved in website development as a project 
manager, as part of the development team of a deployed website which provides solutions to customers who are willing 
to use various coding assistants from different providers in the most efficient way.

   * - **T1 Software Engineer**
     - *Jun 2025 – Present*

Contributing to next-gen SoC virtual platforms and system-level simulation under NDA.  
Contributing to confidential projects involving virtual platform modeling and system-level simulation
for next-generation SoCs. Focused on SystemC/C++ model development, infrastructure modernization,
and multi-architecture integration, delivering production-ready simulation components under strict NDA
guidelines

**Core Stack:** SystemC, C++14, Python, SCons/CMake, Git, Docker, Linux/WSL, CI/CD, pytest

**Key Achievements**

- **Developed SystemC IP and interconnect models** ensuring functional accuracy and performance consistency.
- **Enhanced simulation infrastructure** upgrading modeling frameworks, improving compiler
  compatibility, and refining verification hooks.
- **Optimized multi-core synchronization and code organization** to improve determinism, runtime
  efficiency, and maintainability.
- **Automated build and validation workflows** in CI/CD for reproducible, cross-platform deployments.
- **Standardized version control and dependencies** by migrating legacy repositories to modern workflows.
- **Authored technical documentation and architecture diagrams** to drive model reuse and knowledge transfer.
- **Collaborated cross-functionally** (modeling, verification, EDA tools) to improve fidelity and scalability.

   * - **Full-Stack Engineer (Freelance)**
     - *Jul 2025 – Present*

Delivered a usage-limits and subscription-control platform from backend to admin UI.  
Owned API design, data modeling, and deployment readiness with strong validation and safe default behaviors.  
Streamlined team delivery through clean API-UI contracts, scoped tickets, and disciplined PR practices.

**Core Stack:** Go (Gin), MySQL, Docker, GitHub Actions, TypeScript/JavaScript, SPA

**Key Achievements**

- **Designed REST APIs in Go (Gin)** for groups/limits/access with consistent schemas and robust error
  semantics.
- **Hardened validation** via strict JSON binding, custom validators, and int64 guardrails; reduced
  malformed-request failures.
- **Modeled scalable data** (MySQL) with tuned indexes/queries for predictable latency.
- **Encoded business logic** (windowed counters, enforcement paths, safe defaults) with edge-case safeguards.
- **Built the admin SPA** (forms, filters, pagination) and stabilized the API–UI interface.

   * - **Graduate Software Engineer**
     - *Mar 2023 – Jun 2025*

Developed and validated SystemC virtual hardware models for ARM/Renesas SoCs within a proprietary
simulation platform; focused on functional accuracy, register-level fidelity, and smooth toolchain
integration.

**Core Stack:** SystemC, C++14, Python, SCons/CMake, Jenkins, Git, coverage/regression tooling

**Key Achievements**

- **Integrated 100+ IP/subsystem models** (communication, memory, security, timing) for reusable
  virtual platforms.
- **Developed register-accurate models** improving stability, coverage, and runtime via targeted enhancements.
- **Migrated 10+ repositories to Git** standardizing dependencies/builds and modernizing CI workflows.
- **Aligned with new register-framework standards** adding coverage validation and automated regressions.
- **Resolved cross-platform build issues** across Linux/Windows.
- **Refactored deprecated APIs** to improve reuse and maintainability.
- **Authored documentation and automation scripts** to reduce integration turnaround.

   * - **Independent Project**
     - *Nov 2024 – Mar 2025*

Developed a high-frequency crypto arbitrage engine in Node.js, integrating live market feeds and
secure trade execution across multiple centralized exchanges.
Focused on low-latency data flow, robust error handling, and risk-aware automation to capture
short-lived price discrepancies.

**Stack:** JavaScript (ESM Node.js), WebSocket, REST API, HMAC-SHA256, Telegram Bot API

**Key Achievements**

- **Implemented real-time market aggregation** streaming 1000+ price updates per second from 3
  exchanges via WebSocket with <100 ms processing latency.
- **Built secure trade execution pipelines** integrating HMAC-SHA256-signed REST APIs with full error
  recovery, retry, and backoff mechanisms.
- **Delivered measurable returns** achieving ~7% monthly profit during a 3-month live trading phase
  with stable uptime and controlled drawdown.
