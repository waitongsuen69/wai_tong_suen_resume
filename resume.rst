Junior Software Engineer / SystemC Platform Developer
=====================================================

SystemC/C++ engineer focused on virtual platforms for complex SoCs (Cadence, ASTC). I build register-accurate IP/interconnect models, modernize modeling frameworks, and keep multi-platform toolchains (Linux/WSL/Windows, Docker, CI/CD) reliable for early software bring-up. I partner with architecture, verification, and product teams to deliver deterministic, performant simulations, and I also ship backend services and automation (Go/Gin, Python, Node.js, REST, MySQL, pytest) with clear Sphinx/RST docs.

   * - **Full-Stack Engineer (Freelance)**
     - *Jul 2025 – Present*

Delivered a usage-limits and subscription-control platform from backend to admin UI.  
Owned API design, data modeling, and deployment readiness with strong validation and safe default behaviors.  
Streamlined team delivery through clean API-UI contracts, scoped tickets, and disciplined PR practices.

**Core Stack:** Go (Gin), MySQL, Docker, GitHub Actions, TypeScript/JavaScript, SPA

**Key Achievements**

- **Designed REST APIs in Go (Gin)** for groups/limits/access with consistent schemas and robust error semantics.
- **Hardened validation** via strict JSON binding, custom validators, and int64 guardrails; reduced malformed-request failures.
- **Modeled scalable data** (MySQL) with tuned indexes/queries for predictable latency.
- **Encoded business logic** (windowed counters, enforcement paths, safe defaults) with edge-case safeguards.
- **Built the admin SPA** (forms, filters, pagination) and stabilized the API–UI interface.

   * - **Independent Project**
     - *Nov 2024 – Mar 2025*

Developed a high-frequency crypto arbitrage engine in Node.js, integrating live market feeds and secure trade execution across multiple centralized exchanges.  
Focused on low-latency data flow, robust error handling, and risk-aware automation to capture short-lived price discrepancies.

**Stack:** JavaScript (ESM Node.js), WebSocket, REST API, HMAC-SHA256, Telegram Bot API

**Key Achievements**

- **Implemented real-time market aggregation** streaming 1000+ price updates per second from 3 exchanges via WebSocket with <100 ms processing latency.
- **Built secure trade execution pipelines** integrating HMAC-SHA256-signed REST APIs with full error recovery, retry, and backoff mechanisms.
- **Delivered measurable returns** achieving ~7% monthly profit during a 3-month live trading phase with stable uptime and controlled drawdown.
