Junior Software Engineer / SystemC Platform Developer
=====================================================

SystemC/C++ engineer focused on virtual platforms for complex SoCs (Cadence, ASTC). I build register-accurate IP/interconnect models, modernize modeling frameworks, and keep multi-platform toolchains (Linux/WSL/Windows, Docker, CI/CD) reliable for early software bring-up. Partner closely with architecture, verification, and product teams to deliver deterministic, performant simulations ready for production workflows. Also experienced in backend engineering and automation (Go/Gin, Python, Node.js, REST, MySQL, pytest) and pragmatic documentation (Sphinx/RST).

   * - **Full-Stack Engineer (Freelance)**
     - *Jul 2025 – Present*

Delivered a usage-limits and subscription-control platform from backend to admin UI.  
Owned API design, data modeling, and deployment readiness with strong validation and safe default behaviors.  
Streamlined team delivery through clean API-UI contracts, scoped tickets, and disciplined PR practices.

**Key Achievements**

- **Designed REST APIs in Go (Gin):** implemented endpoints for subscription groups, limit rules, and user-group access with consistent schemas and error handling.
- **Hardened validation:** added strict JSON binding, custom validators, and numeric guardrails (e.g., int64 bounds) to eliminate malformed-request failures.
- **Modeled scalable data:** optimized MySQL schema for clarity and predictable latency via tuned indexes and queries.
- **Encoded business logic cleanly:** implemented windowed counters, enforcement paths, and edge-case safeguards for group and limit policies.
- **Built the admin SPA:** implemented forms, filters, pagination, and client-side validation; integrated new APIs and stabilized the API–UI interface.

   * - **Independent Project**
     - *Nov 2024 – Mar 2025*

Developed a high-frequency crypto arbitrage engine in Node.js, integrating live market feeds and secure trade execution across multiple centralized exchanges.  
Focused on low-latency data flow, robust error handling, and risk-aware automation to capture short-lived price discrepancies.

**Key Achievements**

- **Implemented real-time market aggregation:** streamed 1000+ price updates per second from 3 exchanges via WebSocket with <100 ms processing latency.  
- **Built secure trade execution pipelines:** integrated HMAC-SHA256-signed REST APIs with full error-recovery, retry, and backoff mechanisms.  
- **Integrated Telegram Bot control:** enabled live monitoring, alerting, and manual override through Telegram commands.  
- **Delivered measurable returns:** achieved ~7 % monthly profit during a 3-month live trading phase with stable uptime and controlled drawdown.  
- **Stack:** JavaScript (ESM Node.js), WebSocket, REST API, HMAC-SHA256, Telegram Bot API.
